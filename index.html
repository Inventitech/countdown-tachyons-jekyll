      <h3>Dear Timea,</h3>
      <p>I'm so proud and excited to go <b>together</b> to the US with
      you,* I had to make a count down for it! :-)</p>
      <p>I hope you will also like Seattle (and the many outdoor
      adventures!) that await us. Please also go to the US with an
      open mindset: It is a different culture and things are different
      there -- not necessarily worse. But you can find true nature and
      wilderness there, something you do not get here. However, this
      is essentially why we explore -- if we were to go to the other
      end of the world only to find more of the same, why would we
      need to go at all?</p>
      <p>This domain (pixusa.eu) is also part of your Pixieday
      present, and thus now yours.** Since you told me that you like
      to post pictures instead of writing a lot I thought that pix (=
      pics = pictures) USA would be a good domain name for you and
      others, who are unassuming outsiders to Pixus Club. I hope you
      like the US and the domain and that you will fill it with many
      pictures of our adventures. :-).</p>
