      <h3>Dear Timea,</h3>
      <p>I'm so proud and excited to go <b>together</b> to the US with you, I had to make a count down for it! :-)</p>
      <p>I hope you will also like Seattle (and the many outdoor adventures!) as much as I did. Please also go to the US with an open mindset: It is a different culture and things are different there -- not necessarily as cute and well-prepared as the Netherlands. But you can find true nature and wilderness there, something you do not get here.</p>
      <p>This domain is also part of your birthday present. Since you
      told me that you like to post pictures instead of writing a lot
      I thought that pix (= pics = pictures) USA would be a good
      domain name for it. I hope you like it :-).</p>
      <p><b>&hearts;</b> Moritz</p>
